# Automated SRM Hostel WiFi Login

Whenever you connect to SRM Hostel WiFi, you need to open Network Login Page(i.e. 'https://192.168.10.3/connect/PortalMain') and enter your login credentials. 
So, for ease I've used Python to build an automated bot that uses Selenium framework and Gecko Driver for automating login task in the browser. Gecko Driver is the link between tests in Selenium and the Firefox browser.
